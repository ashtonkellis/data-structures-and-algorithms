The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes.
The puzzle starts with the disks sorted (i.e. smaller disks sits on top of larger disks) on the left-most tower, and the objective of the puzzle is to move the disks to the right-most tower with the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a given time.
A disk is moved from the top of a tower to the top of another tower.
A disk can’t be placed on top of a smaller disk.
On your main file, create…
JavaScript: a function called towersOfHanoi(n)
where n represents the number of disks.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Example
Input	Output
2	Disk 1 moved from A to B
 	Disk 2 moved from A to C
 	Disk 1 moved from B to C
3	Disk 1 moved from A to C
 	Disk 2 moved from A to B
 	Disk 1 moved from C to B
 	Disk 3 moved from A to C
 	Disk 1 moved from B to A
 	Disk 2 moved from B to C
 	Disk 1 moved from A to C
