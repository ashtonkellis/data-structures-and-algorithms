Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

Specifications
Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
Create a branch in your repository called FizzBuzzTree
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a method named FizzBuzzTree() outside of Main() in your Program.cs file. Call Your newly created method in Main() once complete.
JavaScript: a file called fizzbuzztree.js
Python: a file called fizzbuzztree.py
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with it’s news values.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Documentation: Your README.md

Submission Instructions
Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout
Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
Embed the image in your README.md documentation
Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
Merge your branch into master, and delete your branch (don’t worry, the PR link will still work)
