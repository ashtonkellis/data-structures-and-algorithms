Code Challenge
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
You have access to 2 Stack instances with push and pop methods.

Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

Example
enqueue(value)
Input	Args	Output
[10]->[15]->[20]	5	[5]->[10]->[15]->[20]
 	5	[5]
dequeue()
Input	Output	Internal State
[5]->[10]->[15]->[20]	20	[5]->[10]->[15])
[5]->[10]->[15]	15	[5]->[10]
